# Views


Views are essentially dashboards that present relevant information about supported web selectors. We currently support three web selector types: URLs, Domains, and IP-addresses. Views make it easy to pivot between different types of selectors and fingerprints that might be relevant to your investigation.

If you search on an IP-address, you will be

### Phishing Probability
This score is generated by our AI model. It is based on extreme gradient boost classification, and we train it on emerging phishing kits, frameworks, and phishing sites in the wild. Consider it only slightly more accurate than a coin toss. It is NOT a source of truth. The model is  biased towards producing more false positives than false negatives. In other words, it tends to classify more legitimate login sites as malicious than malicious sites as benign. The model is still in an experimental phase. 

### Fingerprints


**HTTP Fingerprint** 


**Server JARM**
This value is the JARM-fingerprint of the IP-address that the scanned URL's domain name points to (the DNS A-record associated with the domain). JARM is a web fingerprinting technique that probes a host’s TLS implementation. It is a hybrid fuzzy hash generated by examining attributes in TLS Server Hello responses resulting from 10 different TLS Client Hello packets sent from the client to the host. JARM hashes can be used to identify clusters of potentially related  servers on the internet. For example, if a certain type of malware/ C2 framework uses a particular out-of-the-box TLS configuration, JARM can help identify other servers that might be part of the same C2 network. JARM was developed by Salesforce’s engineering team in 2020 ([https://engineering.salesforce.com/easily-identify-malicious-servers-on-the-internet-with-jarm-e095edac525a/](https://engineering.salesforce.com/easily-identify-malicious-servers-on-the-internet-with-jarm-e095edac525a/)).
