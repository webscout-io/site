# Views


Views are essentially dashboards that present relevant information about supported web selectors. We currently support three web selector types: URLs, Domains, and IP-addresses. Views make it easy to pivot between different types of selectors and fingerprints that might be relevant to your investigation.

## URLs

If you search on an IP-address, you will be

### Security Vendor Flags
This indicates if the searched URL has been flagged as malicious by any third-party entities, such as search engines and cyber threat intelligence vendors. The purpose is to give different expert opinions in a VirusTotal-like manner. Currently, this feature only supports Google Web Risk (https://cloud.google.com/security/products/web-risk). 

### Indicator Feeds
This indicates if the searched URL has appeared in any popular threat feeds. The cybersecurity community is booming with quality threat intelligence research offered completely free of charge for anyone to use. The problem is that these feeds are scattered around the web, making them difficult to find. This feature provides a single point of entry into more than 100 quality sources of cyber threat intelligence. 

### Threat Intel Mentions
This indicates if the searched URL has appeared in articles or blogposts published by trusted sources of cyber threat intelligence. Please be aware that this check is only performed on publicly available articles. Much of the high quality threat intelligence produced by these sources is only offered through commercial solutions. 

### Phishing Probability
This score is generated by our AI model. It is based on extreme gradient boost classification, and we train it on emerging phishing kits, frameworks, and phishing sites in the wild. Consider it only slightly more accurate than a coin toss. It is NOT a source of truth. The model is  biased towards producing more false positives than false negatives. In other words, it tends to classify more legitimate login sites as malicious than malicious sites as benign. The model is still in an experimental phase. 

### Fingerprints
In the realm of OSINT and cyber threat intelligence, web fingerprints play an important role in identifying, tracking, and understanding digital threats. These fingerprints are unique identifiers - typically hashes of specific web artefacts, such as HTTP request headers or TLS configuration, that can be used to detect patterns and cluster groups of potentially related infrastructure.

#### Server JARM
This value is the JARM-fingerprint of the IP-address that the scanned URL's domain name points to (the DNS A-record associated with the domain). JARM is a web fingerprinting technique that probes a host’s TLS implementation. It is a hybrid fuzzy hash generated by examining attributes in TLS Server Hello responses resulting from 10 different TLS Client Hello packets sent from the client to the host. JARM hashes can be used to identify clusters of potentially related  servers on the internet. For example, if a certain type of malware/ C2 framework uses a particular out-of-the-box TLS configuration, JARM can help identify other servers that might be part of the same C2 network. JARM was developed by Salesforce’s engineering team in 2020 ([https://engineering.salesforce.com/easily-identify-malicious-servers-on-the-internet-with-jarm-e095edac525a/](https://engineering.salesforce.com/easily-identify-malicious-servers-on-the-internet-with-jarm-e095edac525a/)).
